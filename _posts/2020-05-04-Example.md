# H1 heading

## H2 heading

### H3 heading

Here's some basic test. 

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](http://github.come/hongdi-zhao)

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python 
    import numpy as np

    def likes_post(x, y):
        z = np.sum(x,y)
        return 
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read.csv("files.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's an image using HTML:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Harvard.jpg" alt="sample">

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url}}{{ site.baseurl}}/images/Harvard.jpg)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
